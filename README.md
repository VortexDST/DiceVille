The app is a game that aims to entertain. The game is about using different flavors to create
dishes. In phase 1, the player may remove and draw dishes (up to 3 for each). This adds a
‘push your luck’ element. Then, after clicking next, the player will get to pick which 5 dice to
keep, these will be the dice that are tested if they match the conditions for the dish. The player
then gets a win for every successful dish, unless they do not complete one, if they miss one,
even if it is only one, they lose 1 of their 3 health. Game ends at either 30 wins (dishes made) or
0 health.
Use the next phase button to go to the next phase. You can open your inventory to see the
possible dice and dishes. You click on a dice to reserve it or shop it. You can click on the bottom
part of a dish recipe to remove it. Click draw to draw a new one.
